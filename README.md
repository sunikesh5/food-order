## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project was to:
- üçî Practice React Features: Gain hands-on experience with hooks like useState, useEffect, and useReducer.
- üíª Build a Functional App: Implement a simple and interactive food ordering process.
- üé® Enhance UI Skills: Design a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Tech Stack
I built the Food Order App using:

- Lifecycle Management: Used useEffect to implement dynamic updates based on user interactions.
- Component Reusability: Designed reusable components for items, cart, and buttons.

### Responsive Design
